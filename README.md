We are trying to revolutionise the way blinds navigate. There are around 1.3 millions blinds in India  i.e 13 lakhs people in India are blind . The main problem faced by blinds is the “Mobility” , especially when we (India)  is not equipped in terms of infrastucture and technology .
Idea: An app that works :

•Without Internet or network 

•Will help Blinds to navigate by merely using the combination of this app and QR code 

•The QR code will contain the information of the mapping of number of footstep between the current location and the destination 

•The database contains the mapping would be updatable in order to combat with real time infrastructural problem in future
